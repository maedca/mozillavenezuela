== Description ==

The youtube with style plugin allows Wordpress users to easily embed a 
youtube video without the default youtube player, instead with a stylish
player.

You can add a video via the post media manager, and search using 
the You Tube API, and preview videos and automatically insert them into 
your post without leaving your site. 

This way you won't have go back and forth from youtube and your wordpress 
screen.

You can also add a widget to your sidebar with videos from your youtube 
account, and use a lightbox to display them.

Alternatively you can use the youtube shortcode to add a video to your 
post by the following:

* `[youtube]id[/youtube]`

example:

* `[youtube]eBGIQ7ZuuiU[/youtube]`

You can force the width and height of the player with the following 
shortcode: (this overrides the width/height in the settings panel)

* `[youtube width="400" height="300"]eBGIQ7ZuuiU[/youtube]`

These formats also work for showing a youtube video.

* `[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBGIQ7ZuuiU[/youtube]`
* `[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/v/eBGIQ7ZuuiU[/youtube]`
